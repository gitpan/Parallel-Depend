This module will be in beta for the duration
of version X.0.Y (e.g., 4.0.99). The X.1 release
should be stable enough to use.

The current release of P::D requires Perl-5.10 via
"use" syntax in the modules and tests. Smart matches
were just too good to pass up :-)

This module is intended for systems with a working
fork. If your system's fork is broken then it will
not work, or -- worse yet -- work sporadically. 
Adjusting the parameters in the expensive tests
(see next paragraph) will help determine just how
much abuse your system can handle.

Tests in in t/expensive/*t are intended to stress-
test the module. They stress-test your system at
the same time: creating over 100_000 status files
or forking hundreds of jobs in a short period.
All of the really dangerous tests will short-circut
unless EXPENSIVE_TESTS is set in the environment --
for example "EXPENSIVE_TESTS=1 prove --blib t/expenxive
will beat up the system.

All of ./Profile/*  are intended for use with
Devel::Profile. For example:

    perl -d:Profile --blib Profile/phorkatosis;

They are separated in order to avoid adding 
Devel::Profile to the Manifest for the small 
number of cases where anyone cares. Those of us 
who do this kind of profiling will already have 
D::P installed and won't care; everyone else can 
ignore them. These use various levels of 
complexity with jobs aliases to a nil sub:

    sub {}

they test how much overhead there is in the 
P::D code, not the stuff underneath.
